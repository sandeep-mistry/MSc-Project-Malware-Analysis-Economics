# MSc Malware Analysis Economics Project

# Introduction

The largely unexplored area of malware category classification is undertaken on Windows executables, using static analysis
methods including byte-level n-gram analysis and Portable Executable header analysis, and the time and space complexities of these methods are studied. New and original results on per sample feature extraction time and malware throughput are presented and used to construct an overview of how to economically maintain high accuracy. Finally, machine learning classifiers including XGBoost and Random Forest are used to obtain state-of-the-art classification results, which surpass those given in the relevant literature.
